## Contributing
We love pull requests. If you have something you want to add or remove, please open a new pull request. Please read the contribution guidelines before submitting a pull request.

In particular: **if you have commit access, please don't merge changes without waiting a week for everybody to leave feedback**.

### Getting Feedback

Since these are our guides, we want everyone at Aan Zee to see them. We are probably in another timezone than you, so we leave all PRs open for at
least a week to get feedback from everyone.
